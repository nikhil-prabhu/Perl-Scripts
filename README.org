* Perl-Scripts
  
  A repository containing simple practice scripts written in Perl5.
  
* About
  
  This repository contains all the scripts that I wrote/write while learning and practicing Perl5. I'm quite new to Perl at the time of writing this, so the scripts may not be that practical and may lack quality; but this should improve as I keep learning.
